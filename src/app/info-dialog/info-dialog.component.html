  <h3>About this App</h3>
  <p>This app is saving all times between check-in and check-out in the localStorage.</p>
  <p>Then it is calculating the total time of this times.</p>
  <p>Then it calculates a Start- and End-time (start is set to 8:00) which adds the time for the break (30min after 6h and 45min after 9h).</p>
  <p>If only two times (check-in and check-out) then a break time is removed from total time.</p>
